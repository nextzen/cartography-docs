# Mapzen Cartography Documentation

Mapzen provides several open-source map styles and hundreds of map icons that can be used in [mapzen.js](https://mapzen.com/documentation/mapzen-js/) or [Tangram](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/) as an extension of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for making maps for the web and mobile devices. Mapzen basemap styles simplify the process of using Mapzen's vector tiles within Leaflet.
